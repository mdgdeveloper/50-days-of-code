# Write a function called email_validator that takes a list of
# emails and checks if the emails are valid. The function returns a
# list of only valid emails. A valid email address will have the
# following - @ symbol (if the @ sign is at the beginning of the
# name, the email is invalid. If there are more than one @signs,
# the email is invalid. All valid emails must have a dot com at the
# end (.com), if not, the email is invalid. For example, the list of
# emails above should output the following as valid emails:
# ['ben@mail.com', 'kenny@gmail.com']
# If no emails in the list are valid, the function should return â€˜all emails are
# invalid

# Regex:
# [A-Za-z0-9]+@[A-Za-z0-9]+.com
