# Write a function called inter_section that takes two lists and
# finds the intersection (the elements that are present in both
# lists). The function should return a tuple of intersections. Use
# list comprehension in your solution. Use the lists below. Your
# function should return (30, 65, 80).
# list1 = [20, 30, 60, 65, 75, 80, 85]
# list2 = [ 42, 30, 80, 65, 68, 88, 95]


def inter_section(list1, list2):
    result = tuple([x for x in list1 if x in list2])

    return result


# Test
print(inter_section([20, 30, 60, 65, 75, 80, 85],
      [42, 30, 80, 65, 68, 88, 95]))
