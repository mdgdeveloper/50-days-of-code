# Write a function called nested_lists that takes any number of
# lists and creates a 2-dimensional nested list of lists. For example,
# if you pass the following lists as arguments: [1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3,
# 4], [1, 3, 4, 5].
# Your code should return: [[1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 4, 5]]

def nested_lists(*args):
    result = []

    for n in args:
        result.append(n)

    return result


# Test
print(nested_lists([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 4, 5]))
